# Data-Analyst-Portfolio
This repository acts as my Data Analyst Portfolio. 

Hi, I’m Bren Bliss, a passionate data enthusiast making the exciting transition from ServiceNow development to data analysis. With a background in building solutions for complex business problems, I’ve recently completed the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, where I honed my skills in SQL, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My goal is to leverage these skills to solve real-world problems, optimize processes, and drive impactful decisions. I’m excited to contribute to projects that challenge me and help organizations turn data into their strongest asset.
